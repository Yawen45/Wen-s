      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>Photography is one of my ways of seeing everything differently. I see things way differently than other. just like how I see sunsets and everyone just plainly see it as how a day ends but to me it reminds me that hope is always there at the end of the day.</p>

      <h3>Skilled in Sports</h3>
      <p>Specifically volleyball, table tennis, and frisbee.)
Ssports has been a great help for me in escaping  reality. I fell in love with volleyball since 6th grade and until now I just can't stop playing. 
table tennis was something unique for me because it requires endurance and speed so I was challenge for playing it and it was so fun. 
frisbee on the other hand was more challenging because it's a track and field sports so it has more space to run around the field while playing. it's tiring but fun.</p>
